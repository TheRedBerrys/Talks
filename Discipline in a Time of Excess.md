# Discipline in a Time of Excess

Imagine, if you will, it is a cool summer night in Jerusalem, approximately one thousand years before the birth of Christ. The sweet smell of lamb cooking on open flames wafts through the desert air. Faintly, in the distance, musicians can be heard singing and playing primitive instruments.

You are David, King of Israel. In your youth, you were anointed to be King by Samuel the prophet. Later, you killed Goliath, the Phillistine, in an epic battle. The old King, Saul, tried to have you killed many times, but you have been consistently protected by the Lord. Finally, Saul was killed in battle and you were given the throne. The fate of the Lord's chosen people, not to mention the fulfillment of Messianic prophesies, depend upon your righteous reign.

On this particular night, weary from managing the affairs of Israel, you have retired to the roof of your palace. There, you see, on another rooftop, a beautiful woman. Perhaps having thought she was in private, Bathsheba is in a state of immodesty as she bathes.

Being the King of Israel, you have many wives and concubines, an arrangement which has been given a rare acceptance by God. Bathsheba, meanwhile, is the only wife of Uriah the Hittite, a soldier in the Israelite army. You know with absolute certainty that to watch Bathsheba bathe is a sin, and yet, for some mysterious reason that even you don't fully understand, you just can't seem to look away.

The scriptures tell us that, after this initial sin, David would go onto commit adultery with Bathsheba, kill her husband Uriah, and lose many of the blessings promised to him by the Lord.

David had been, up until that point, an exceptionally righteous king and a paragon of virtue in a time of widespread iniquity. Surely he had experienced, and resisted, many such temptations before. So why, on this night, did David fall?

This question can be worded more generally: why do good people do bad things? Why do husbands, after honorably working all day to support their families, get home and treat their wives and children unkindly? Why do wives, after years of faithful marriage, succumb to the advances of another man? Why do good students cheat on tests when they could have done just fine without cheating? Why do righteous people, who have been living a Gospel life for decades, commit sin that puts them on a pathway to certain destruction?

## Willpower is a Muscle

Three thousand years after David, recent behavioral science gives us clues to the answer to these questions. A great deal of research has been done in this area, and it can be boiled down to a single, simple phrase: willpower is a muscle.

While many different studies have helped lead to this understanding, only one of them has chocolate chip cookies, so we'll discuss that one. In this study, subjects were brought into a room with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies--the air still had that fresh cookie smell which you are imagining now. Some of the subjects were allowed to indulge in the cookies, while others were denied the cookies and, quite cruelly, asked to eat some radishes instead.

The test subjects were then taken to a different room where they were asked to work on a complex maze. Unbeknownst to the subjects, the maze was actually unsolvable; the scientists were only watching to see how long the subjects worked on the maze before giving up. The results were unexpected: those who had to resist the temptation of the cookies worked for less than half the time before giving up as those who were able to indulge in the cookies. In subsequent studies, a persistent pattern emerged wherein the more willpower people had to exert before working on the maze, the less time they were able to spend on the maze before they could no longer continue on.

While we won't discuss all of the studies that lead to these conclusions, there are three elements to the understanding that willpower is a muscle:

1. Like a physical muscle, there is a finite amount of strength the willpower muscle has, and once that strength is used up, we have to let it recover for some period of time before we can exercise it again.
2. Like a physical muscle, the strength of the willpower muscle is transferable; improving the willpower muscle's strength in one area (for example, physically working out) leads to increased willpower strength in all other areas (for example, in financial decision-making).
3. Like a physical muscle, if we regularly exercise the willpower muscle, it will get stronger over time.
 
## Finite amount of willpower

Like all true principles, once we have this understanding that willpower is a muscle, many experiences and observations we have had begin to make sense. One very clear example in this case is dieting. Why is it that many people begin a diet plan successfully, but then fall back to their old ways of eating in three or four weeks? The answer is that many diets require a constant exertion of willpower--with every bite, every minute of the day, these diets require people to eat things they don't like and avoid foods they do like. Diets like this can never be successful long term--that type of success requires a pattern of willpower exertion followed by willpower rest.

King Benjamin, in his great sermon, tells us that "it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength." This scripture might seem strange--wouldn't it make more sense to say, "it is not POSSIBLE that a man should run faster than he has strength"? How can a man run faster than he has strength? What King Benjamin was really describing was this idea that continuous exertion of willpower is not sustainable.

In finance, there's an old adage that "just because you have the money for it, doesn't mean you can afford it." King Benjamin's statement can be understood in a similar way--just because you have the ability to do something now, doesn't mean it won't affect what you can do later. A man "running faster than he has strength" refers to a person using up his entire store of willpower and then having none left to resist temptation or do something the Lord wants him to do.

How can we apply this knowledge that willpower is finite to better live the Gospel? The most important thing to remember is that, if you have exerted a large amount of willpower recently, you are more susceptible to temptation. If you have just spent a long time studying, the temptation to view pornography will be harder to resist. If you are coming home from a hard day at work, you are more likely to lost your temper with your spouse or children. Even praying and reading scriptures can leave you temporarily easier to tempt.

Knowing that we are more susceptible to temptation after exerting willpower allows us to manage our schedules so that we can avoid temptation during low-willpower times. After exercising or studying, we can avoid computers or other devices where pornography is easy to access. When we come home from work every day, we can spend a few minutes relaxing alone so we can be in a good mood when dealing with our families. When we have spent a long day serving as the King of Israel, we can avoid rooftops where bathing women might be seen. The details will depend on the particulars of your situation, but being mindful about your schedule will help you avoid temptation when you are weakest in dealing with it.

## Transferable

The second aspect of willpower is that it is transferable; in other words, developing willpower in one area of life leads to greater willpower in all areas of life.
