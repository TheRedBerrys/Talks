# Discipline in a Time of Excess

Imagine, if you will, it is a cool summer night in Jerusalem, approximately one thousand years before the birth of Christ. The sweet smell of lamb cooking on open flames wafts through the desert air. Faintly, in the distance, musicians can be heard singing and playing primitive instruments.

You are David, King of Israel. In your youth, you were anointed to be King by Samuel the prophet. Later, you killed Goliath, the Phillistine, in an epic battle. The old King, Saul, tried to have you killed many times, but you have been consistently protected by the Lord. Finally, Saul was killed in battle and you were given the throne. The fate of the Lord's chosen people, not to mention the fulfillment of Messianic prophesies, depend upon your righteous reign.

On this particular night, weary from managing the affairs of Israel, you have retired to the roof of your palace. There, you see, on another rooftop, a beautiful woman. Perhaps having thought she was in private, Bathsheba is in a state of immodesty as she bathes.

Being the King of Israel, you have many wives and concubines, an arrangement which has been given a rare acceptance by God. Bathsheba, meanwhile, is the only wife of Uriah the Hittite, a soldier in the Israelite army. You know with absolute certainty that to watch Bathsheba bathe is a sin, and yet, for some mysterious reason that even you don't fully understand, you just can't seem to look away.

The scriptures tell us that, after this initial sin, David would go onto commit adultery with Bathsheba, kill her husband Uriah, and lose many of the blessings promised to him by the Lord.

David had been, up until that point, an exceptionally righteous king and a paragon of virtue in a time of widespread iniquity. Surely he had experienced, and resisted, many such temptations before. So why, on this night, did David fall?

This question can be worded more generally: why do good people do bad things? Why do husbands, after honorably working all day to support their families, get home and treat their wives and children unkindly? Why do wives, after years of faithful marriage, succumb to the advances of another man? Why do good students cheat on tests when they could have done just fine without cheating? Why do righteous people, who have been living a Gospel life for decades, commit sin that puts them on a pathway to certain destruction?

## Willpower is a Muscle

Three thousand years after David, recent behavioral science gives us clues to the answer to these questions. A great deal of research has been done in this area, and it can be boiled down to a single, simple phrase: willpower is a muscle.
