# Following Jesus, Learning from Toothpaste

Brothers and sisters, today I’m going to speak to you about Jesus, football, and toothpaste.

## "The Children of this World are Wiser Than the Children of Light"

The teachings of Jesus, as recorded in the Scriptures, elicit many emotions--joy, comfort, and hope are common. There are some passages, however, that prompt a wholly different emotion: confusion. These verses, at least when first read, can seem downright nonsensical. This, like every other aspect of Jesus’ ministry, is deliberate. In stark contrast to the mind-dumbing platitudes all too common in our present discourse, these scriptures both require, and reward, repeated reading and pondering. Indeed, the primary purpose of Jesus’ teaching in parables is that their deeper meanings are revealed to us if, and only if, we make an effort to understand them beyond merely a cursory reading.

One such parable is the Parable of the Unjust Steward, found in Luke chapter 16. While we won’t review this parable as part of the current discussion (though I encourage you to read and ponder it on your own), Jesus’ single sentence of explanation is arguably more confusing than the parable itself: “For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.” The phrase “children of this world” clearly refers to those without religion, and “children of light” similarly refers to those who follow Christ.

This line of thought quickly leads us to an uncomfortable place: the only reasonable way to parse this sentence is that Jesus is declaring those without religion to be more wise than the faithful. This conclusion not only makes us, who like to think of ourselves as faithful, extremely uncomfortable; it also seems to directly contradict the central tenant of Jesus’ body of teaching--the only wise way to live (and the only way acceptable to God) is by strict and rigorous adherence to Gospel principles.

If Jesus is not using the word “wise” in the way we normally see it used in the scriptures, He must be using it in some other way. James E. Talmage in his book “Jesus the Christ” explains this passage:

‘Our Lord’s purpose was to show the contrast between the care, thoughtfulness, and devotion of men engaged in the money-making affairs of earth, and the half-hearted ways of many who are professedly striving after spiritual riches. Worldly-minded men do not neglect provision for their future years, and often are sinfully eager to amass plenty; while the “children of light,” or those who believe spiritual wealth to be above all earthly possessions, are less energetic, prudent, or wise.’

This indictment of our collective energy in living the Gospel is simultaneously both painfully stinging and excruciatingly accurate. Japanese businessmen literally work themselves to death so frequently that their language has a word for it; meanwhile, most wards in the Church struggle to have a home teaching rate above 50%. NFL quarterback Peyton Manning is so dedicated to his profession that he built his own room in which to review game film, and he plans his family’s pregnancies such that all of his children have been born during the offseason; in contrast, many of our temples operate on limited schedules because of sparse attendance. My college roommate used to routinely play World of Warcraft for 12 hours at a time in order to get his Death Knight to level 70. Brothers and Sisters, I ask you: would an outside observer determine, based on our actions, that the Gospel is more important to us than World of Warcraft?

## Goals

Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave another example in the October 2014 General Conference:

‘I recently met a fine teenage young man. His goals were to go on a mission, obtain an education, marry in the temple, and have a faithful happy family. I was very pleased with his goals. But during further conversation, it became evident that his conduct and the choices he was making were not consistent with his goals. I felt he genuinely wanted to go on a mission and was avoiding serious transgressions that would prohibit a mission, but his day-to-day conduct was not preparing him for the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, and spiritual challenges he would face. He had not learned to work hard. He was not serious about school or seminary. He attended church, but he had not read the Book of Mormon. He was spending a large amount of time on video games and social media. He seemed to think that showing up for his mission would be sufficient. Young men, please recommit to worthy conduct and serious preparation to be emissaries of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.’

This framing of the issue as goals and the behaviors necessary to achieve those goals is instructive. We have many noble possible goals in the Gospel: to be baptized and confirmed, to receive our endowments in the Temple, to serve an honorable full-time mission, to be sealed to our families, to raise righteous children, to share the joy of the Gospel with those we love, and ultimately to enter the Celestial Kingdom. Generally speaking, we have no problem creating and understanding righteous goals. Furthermore, we all know more or less how to achieve these goals; indeed, the path to achieve almost any Gospel goal can be answered by our standard “Primary answers” of daily scripture study and prayer, faithful church attendance, diligent following of the commandments, and a consistent striving to treat those around us with love.

In the face of such admirable and clear goals, with such well-known and simple actions required to achieve them, how can it be that our day-to-day behavior is so lacking? And what can be done to improve it? Surely, the Lord has not left us without help. The Scriptures contain a wealth of answers to the questions of what we should do and why we should do it, but they are often surprisingly light in answering the question of how we can do these things if they do not come naturally to us. For this knowledge, we will now turn to some outside sources, invoking the direction in Doctrine and Covenants Section 109 to seek knowledge “out of the best books” and to learn “by study” as well as “by faith.”

## Habits

While human behavior can seem unexplainable, under close enough scrutiny patterns start to emerge with predictable regularity. For example, much of humans’ and animals’ everyday behaviors are dictated by habit, and researchers now understand, at least to some degree, the mechanisms that drive these habitual behaviors. The primary purpose of habit in the general sense is that it allows the brain spend less energy on controlling behavior, freeing it up to spend more energy watching out for hungry lions. Even though humans have now invented buildings so that hungry lions are less of a priority in our normal lives, this process of forming habits remains, and depending on the circumstance it can be either to our detriment or our benefit.

We’ll leave the more technical details for the lecture hall, but for our purposes it will suffice to say that a habit is comprised of three components: a cue, a routine, and a reward. The cue is some stimulus, be it a sound, sight, smell, or often, an emotion. This stimulus cues the brain to get the routine ready. The routine is the behavior which requires little or no conscious thought to complete. Finally, the reward occurs after the behavior, which tells the brain that the routine is worthwhile. This reward can be as simple as a pleasant feeling or as insidious as the powerful highs caused by illicit drugs. Subconsciously, the person or animal learns that when it is exposed to the cue, it can perform the routine and obtain the reward.

An example of a habit that most of us are probably all too familiar with is compulsive phone checking. The cue for this behavior is usually a slight tinge of boredom. When we notice that feeling, we follow the routine of pulling the phone out of our pocket and check to see if we have any emails, text messages, or invitations from grandma to join her in a game of Candy Crush (sorry Grandma, the answer is still “No”). The brain is rewarded with a momentary distraction from whatever task, thought, or Sacrament meeting talk is causing the boredom in the first place. Because the brain loves nothing more than momentary distractions, it keeps this routine around for the next time we feel a tinge of boredom, even though we know how rude and arrogant it makes us look.

So, what does this have to do with achieving our Gospel goals? The behaviors God asks of us, He asks of us on a daily basis, or in other words, He asks us to make a habit out of them. Also, many behaviors that draw us away from achieving our goals are typically performed as part of a habit: think of the phrase “drug habit”. If we are to follow Jesus the way we have been asked, eliminating negative habits and forming positive habits is of the utmost importance to us.

## A Brief History of Toothpaste

This brings us, finally, to toothpaste. It may seem unthinkable now, but 100 years ago, almost no Americans brushed their teeth. In fact, the medical community was divided as to whether brushing teeth was helpful or harmful. By a quirk of history, the invention of toothpaste coincided with the advent of the advertising industry, meaning that a man named Claude Hopkins tasked himself selling toothpaste, and by extension the habit of brushing teeth, to the public.

The first tactic Hopkins used was to create a cue for brushing teeth. He created advertisements that read, “Run your tongue across your teeth. You’ll feel a film--that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay. Pepsodent removes the film!” (Advertisements were less pithy in the early 20th century). Hopefully, people would see the advertisements, notice their mouths feeling gross, and think, “I need to go get some Pepsodent!”

Unfortunately for Hopkins, this tactic didn’t seem to work very well, and sales stayed flat. But then he had a rather novel idea--he put a peppermint additive in the toothpaste, giving it a strong but pleasant aroma and making the paste cause a slight tingling feeling in the mouth after using it. The smell and tingling were just enough to be an effective reward in the habit loop. Within weeks, despite the fact that Pepsodent makes a better spackle than toothpaste, stores couldn’t keep it on the shelves. Soon, many other companies copied the Pepsodent formula, and the toothpaste revolution was complete. Fortunately for us, later scientific studies revealed that daily brushing of teeth is the single most important practice in maintaining good oral health.

## Creating Good Habits

If we want to develop good Gospel habits, we can follow the Pepsodent example: we simply need the three elements of cue, routine, and reward.

The cue we choose can be something we see, hear, or feel. For instance, when we first open our eyes in bed, we can access the scriptures on our phone and read to help us wake up.

The routine then is to actually do the thing the Lord has asked us to do. When we are finished, we give ourselves a reward to finish the loop. The reward can be something simple--maybe we eat a Tic-Tac after we finish. For each person, the reward will be different, but researchers say it should be something physical, like a small piece of candy, or a minute in a massage chair, or something similar. This is because, for the habit to take, the brain has to feel a craving for the reward when you experience the cue, and we tend to feel cravings for physical things like food.

As we follow this pattern, we have a high probability of successfully forming a habit. This also happens quite quickly; the old adage that to form a habit we must do that thing 21 days in a row appears to be mostly hokum.

## Eliminating Bad Habits

We can also use this procedure to rid ourselves of bad habits, like the habitual sinning that is the most common way we engage in sin. Because these sins are already habits, the cue, routine, and reward are already present. A rather extreme example is viewing pornography. Many people struggling to overcome this habit report that the cue for this behavior simply turning on their computer. With almost no conscious thought, the person then engages in the learned routine of accessing and viewing pornographic material. In this case, researchers have learned that the reward is the release of a large amount of dopamine, the brain’s powerful ‘feel-good’ chemical that regulates motivation and reward. This same chemical is released by a variety of drugs, which explains why pornography and drug habits are so notoriously difficult to break, since dopamine causes intense feelings of enjoyment.

If we identify the cues that drive our negative behaviors, we can either try to avoid those cues or develop new routines and rewards to associate with them. Most of the time, these cues are impossible to avoid, so the better choice is to pick out a new routine and reward to replace the old ones. For the example of pornography, the routine of finding pornographic material can be replaced with a new routine--say, looking at pictures of cute cats instead. That might sound silly, but researchers have also found that looking at pictures of cute animals or babies releases oxytocin, another powerful ‘feel-good’ chemical.

The actual routine you pick to replace the poor behavior doesn’t matter, as long as either that routine has its own rewards (like looking at cute cats), or you pair it with some other reward that you find motivating. People often try to kick bad habits and fail because they only replace the routine, without replacing the reward. To build a good habit or to replace a bad habit you must have the cue, the routine, and the reward all in place.

## Reciting Gospel Goals

I spoke earlier about Gospel goals. Might I suggest one good habit to make: reciting your Gospel goals. Sit down and write out your goals with a wording you find to be powerful personally. Then, develop a habit of reciting these goals (whether out loud or just in your mind) whenever you feel tempted to sin. For instance, you might get angry and be tempted to raise your voice to your spouse. Instead, you might recite to yourself: “My goal is to be an instrument in God’s hand in answering the prayers of those around me. My goal is to be an instrument in God’s hand in answering the prayers of those around me.” Then reward yourself with a small treat or simply take a deep breath and move on. By turning the temptation to sin into a cue for this powerful habit, you will be able to consistently remind yourself of your goals as well as feel the influence of the Holy Ghost, an inevitable consequence of this practice.

## Conclusion

Earlier I mentioned Peyton Manning and his commitment to success in football. Do you think he needs his wife to remind him to review game film and study his craft? Does he, or any other successful football player, need help in making sure they lift weights every day? Of course not! They made these behaviors, so crucial to success in their field, into consistent habits long ago.

When Jesus said “the children of this world are ... wiser than the children of light,” He wasn’t endorsing the goals these non-religious people are achieving, but He was instructing us to follow their example in turning important behaviors into foundational habits we engage in every day.

The Scriptures tell us that by “small and simple” means, “great things are brought to pass.” The knowledge we have discussed about habit forming can certainly be considered “small and simple”, and there is no doubt that the eternal life we seek is a “great thing,” certainly much more worthy of our energy than success in business, sports, or (heaven forbid) World of Warcraft. By applying this knowledge to our lives, we can demonstrate and improve our commitment to the Gospel that Jesus requires of us.

I know that Christ lives, and that He loves us and wants us to succeed. I know that as we give our best effort, God will help us. And I know that with His help, there is no way that we can fail. I leave this testimony with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
